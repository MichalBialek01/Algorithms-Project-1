### Project: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
###The project involves the implementation and analysis of selected sorting algorithms and testing their efficiency on IMDb datasets. The chosen algorithms are:

- **Merge Sort
- **Quicksort
- **Introspective Sort
- **Bucket Sort
### Tasks:

Algorithm Implementation: These algorithms should be implemented independently according to the materials discussed in the lectures.
Data Filtering: Remove empty entries from the input data, prepare datasets of various sizes (from 10,000 to the maximum amount of data).
Efficiency Analysis: Detailed performance analysis of the implemented algorithms on the prepared datasets.
Results Reporting: Prepare a report containing a description of the applied algorithms, experiment results (tables, graphs), and conclusions.

Additional Requirements:
- **Correctness Verification: Check the correctness of algorithm operation, especially for large datasets.
- **Documentation: The report should include a bibliography of the used sources.
Project Objective
The project aims to understand and analyze the efficiency of sorting algorithms and their ability to work with real-world datasets.
